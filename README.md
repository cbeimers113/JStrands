2D Natural Selection Simulator

Simulates natural selection of 2D creatures by mutating 7 characteristics to either give or take advantageous behaviour in the search for food. The creatures also learn what parts of the map are dangerous and which have food, and they can pass down their "memories" to the next generation. The program includes a "graphs" view to show statistics and population charts as well as visualizing the speciation history, most fit DNA, and most fit map memory (called "visual cortex").
